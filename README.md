It's a thing made in monogame using C#

I was bored one day, and started this. Now trying to use github for the first time to don't feel like I have wasted time on this project

You can do whatever you want with this code, I don't care, it's just a fun little side project that I'm doing when I'm bored

Oh yeah and you can give me ideas if you want, I still have a few in mind, but I might run out of ideas soon, so....
